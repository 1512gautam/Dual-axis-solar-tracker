# dual-axis-solar-tacker

Overview
This repository contains the design, code, and documentation for a Dual-Axis Solar Tracker project. The dual-axis solar tracker aims to maximize the efficiency of solar panels by continuously orienting them towards the sun. By using both azimuthal and elevational adjustments, the tracker ensures that the panels receive the maximum possible sunlight throughout the day, leading to increased energy production.

Features
Dual-Axis Tracking: Tracks the sun's position in both azimuth and elevation, ensuring optimal solar exposure.
Real-Time Sun Positioning: Utilizes real-time data to adjust the panel's position dynamically.
Energy Efficiency: Increases the efficiency of solar panels by up to 30% compared to fixed-position systems.
Microcontroller-Based Control: Powered by a microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi) for precise control and automation.
Sensor Integration: Incorporates light sensors (e.g., LDRs) to detect sunlight intensity and adjust positioning.
Weather Resilience: Features mechanisms to protect the panels during adverse weather conditions.
Scalability: Design can be scaled to accommodate different sizes and types of solar panels.
Components
Microcontroller: Arduino or Raspberry Pi
Motors: Servo or stepper motors for precise movement
Sensors: Light Dependent Resistors (LDRs), gyroscope for orientation
Power Supply: Solar panel and battery system
